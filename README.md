# RecycLab – A Smart Waste Management App

## Overview
**RecycLab** is a cutting-edge waste management solution that leverages AI-powered image recognition, cloud-based data storage, and real-time geolocation services to help users identify, categorize, and properly dispose of waste. Designed for both individuals and communities, RecycLab promotes eco-friendly waste disposal practices by guiding users towards sustainable solutions based on the type of waste. This app empowers individuals to actively participate in environmental preservation, reducing landfill contributions and pollution through smart, tech-driven waste management.

## Project Workflow
1. **Waste Identification**  
   - Users upload an image of waste material via the app.
   - An AI image classification model analyzes the image and determines the waste type (e.g., plastic, organic, paper, metal, or electronic waste).
   
2. **Waste Classification and Recommendation**  
   - Based on the waste category, the app provides recycling guidelines and best disposal practices to minimize environmental impact.

3. **Locate Recycling Centers**  
   - The app uses Google Maps and Places API to locate nearby recycling or waste treatment centers specific to the waste type.
   - Users can access driving directions, operating hours, and contact information for these centers.

4. **Track Waste Disposal**  
   - Users can monitor their waste contributions through a personalized dashboard that records past disposals, promoting consistency in responsible waste management.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React for a responsive user interface, Google Maps for geolocation, and React Google Maps Component for map integration.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express for API requests, data processing, and cloud service interaction.
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow.js for image classification; an alternative backend model with TensorFlow Lite can also be deployed via Python for enhanced accuracy.
- **Database & Cloud Storage:** Firebase Firestore (free tier) for quick access and scalability, and Google Cloud Storage for images and data.
- **Google APIs:** Google Maps API for geolocation, Places API for locating recycling centers, and Directions API for route mapping.

## Implementation & Purpose
- **AI-Powered Waste Identification**  
  RecycLab uses a pre-trained image recognition model (TensorFlow Lite or TensorFlow.js) to identify waste types from user-uploaded images, simplifying waste categorization for all users.

- **Cloud Integration for Data Storage**  
  The app integrates with Google Cloud Storage and Firebase Firestore, storing images and user data securely, allowing smooth data retrieval and scalability.

- **Geolocation for Recycling Centers**  
  Google Maps and Places API integration helps users locate nearby recycling facilities based on waste type, reducing logistical challenges and encouraging community involvement in recycling.

## Future Scalability
- **Community Engagement Features:**  
  - *Gamification:* Points or rewards for responsible waste management to foster a sustainable community.
  - *Social Sharing:* Enables users to raise awareness by sharing their environmental contributions.

- **Expanded Waste Categorization:**  
  As AI advances, the app can expand to recognize more waste categories (e.g., hazardous materials, textiles, specific plastics), serving a broader range of user needs.

- **Data Analytics and Reports:**  
  - Data analytics dashboards to track community waste contributions, assisting municipalities and NGOs in environmental policymaking.
  - Geographic analysis of waste data to identify prevalent waste types in specific areas, guiding targeted awareness campaigns and resource allocation.

## Social Welfare and Environmental Impact
RecycLab addresses critical societal issues such as ineffective waste disposal and pollution by educating users and providing easy access to recycling solutions. By fostering environmentally conscious behavior, the app reduces the burden on landfills. The waste tracking dashboard motivates individuals to monitor and improve their disposal habits, reducing pollution and promoting sustainable waste practices.

### Impact on Society
1. **Environmental Awareness:** RecycLab educates individuals on responsible waste disposal, spreading awareness of the ecological footprint of their actions.
2. **Reduced Pollution:** Proper waste classification and disposal reduce pollution levels, mitigating environmental harm.
3. **Community Collaboration:** By connecting individuals with local recycling facilities, RecycLab enhances local efforts towards a cleaner, greener society.
